simple-vCloudPHP
================

A simplified set of functions in dealing with the vCloud PHP SDK. Requires vCloud SDK v5.1


Installation:

- Get the VMware vCloud SDK for PHP at this page: 
      http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/developer/forums/vcloudsdkphp

- Extract it. Put a proper config.php into place. Update to your environment for login details and web proxy information
- Run our sample vStats.php 


This is a very early project and mainly looking to simplify the use of vCloud within PHP. Any pull requests welcomed.
